        <h2>Implementation of mockup</h2>
        <p>
          This assignment required that we implemented wireframes/mockups from a
          designer group into production ready code. In order to carry out this
          project we divided and delegated different tasks and responsibilities
          internally in the group to be able to deliver the project within a
          timely manner. After the tasks and responsibilities were delegated we
          sat up a Github repo for team collaboration where we pushed and pulled
          the code to streamline the workflow across the team. This exercice
          where we utilised Github facilitated for learning one of the most
          important tools out there for efficient and professional software
          development. We also carried out the practice of commits, branch
          creation, merging of branch, creation of pull requests and merging of
          pull requests.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some of the choices we made for this particular project was across
          different "segments/areas" of the delivery. What we mean by that is
          that we didnt just focus upon how to carry out the coding in of itself
          according to the mockups received, but we focused upon utilising
          knowledgde acquired from different subjects such as project
          management, task delegation, responsibilites, code structure, how and
          where to comment, file structure, folder structure and color
          combination amongst other things.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some concrete examples of aspects we considered regarding project
          management was that we sat up a messenger group for clear
          communication between all team members, created and defined guidelines
          on how to push and commit code for streamlining the workflow as well
          as plan continous meetings to review and discuss the progress on the
          project. During this process we were able to take desicions together
          on the mentioned points above, get experience on working in a team,
          learn to listen and evaluate other members suggestions and have
          discussions on different subjcts and technologies we've learned thus
          far. Which again contriutes to properly grasping the different
          subjects we touch upon in the lectures and when going through the
          slides.
        </p>
        <p>
          The challenges we faced during the development of the entire project
          was in relation with the mockups and the task description. The mockups
          we received were not adequate in terms of the requirements in the
          task, for example the mockups didnt include any images, placeholder
          for where to insert images, type of images etc. This required us
          rethink and design the site a bit differently than what was laid out
          in the mockups. For instance, in order to meet the requirements of
          using appropriate images for the articles we had to create a 2 column
          layout on desktop. Whereas the mockups had one column layout. Though
          on mobile view we did collapse our layout to 1 column.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, there were no guidelines on how and where the footer
          should be. To address this, we sat the footer at the bottom and used
          position absolute followed by the properties "bottom and top" in order
          to align the content within the footer.
        </p>
        <p>
          A part from the above mentioned point in terms of image setup, we
          didnt face any particular challenge. Though I would suggest to include
          a bit more details on where to place content/images for future
          mockups. The rest of the information provided in the mockups were
          descriptive and facilitated that we created a nice design with good
          color combinations and making it appealing to view. This mockup is
          rated 3 out of 5.

        <h2>Sustainability</h2>
        <p>
          In order to cater for sustainability and reduce the carbon footprint
          we adressed and implemented several steps. Such as making sure our
          images are fully optimised for the web, having a short and consise
          color pallette, ensuring that we dont have unnecessary code which
          again will lead to less bandwidth consumed for when the site is
          visited by end-users. One thing we could have done better is to reduce
          the font face types from 3 down to 2, that would have good impact on
          the carbon footrprint as well. But since the mockups required that we
          used 3 different fonts, our approached adhered parallaly to meet the
          requirements. One of the most important actions we took for saving
          filesizer and reducing our carbon footprint was to compress
          and optimise our images. Below you can see a table providing an 
          overview of before and after opimisations. The exact measures we did 
          was to scale down the images, saving for web plus making sure the filetypes were 
          .JPG with right quality percentage and dimensions. It wasnt particularly hard to 
          do, it was more like fine tuning the scaling of images to fit the display needs
          of the images on our website. We could also have used .webp as that is smaller, but in order to ensure
          cross browser compatibility we chose to go onwards with .JPG.

        <h2>Self reflection over own mockup</h2>
        <p>
          In retrospect when we review our delivered mockup we see there are
          room for improvements. For instance we should have informed about the
          different fonts we would like the developers to implement, colors on
          headings or backgrounds and in general be mroe descriptive. By
          experiencing the difficulties/challenges of an info lacking mockup it
          is more natural for us to think of these aspects next time drawing
          mockups.
        </p>
        <p>
          We think that other groups probably faced some of the same challenges
          we faced during development of the mockup we received. For example,
          the way we struggled with the layout development due to missing
          information of images, other groups might face difficulties finding
          the proper color combinations and font styles as we didnt provide
          thorough information on those aspects.
        </p>
        <p>
          This exersice gave us proper insight on how important it is to provide
          not only enough information, but to the nitty gritty detail in order
          to ensure a good development process that meets expectations and
          requirements. Taken into consideration the lacks in our mockup, it is
          still possible to use the designs as guidelines for setting up the
          newsletter site. We would rate our mockups 3 out 5.
